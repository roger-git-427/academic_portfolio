# academic_portfolio

This repository contains a curated portfolio of academic and applied data science projects developed during my undergraduate studies in Data Science and Mathematics at Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey. Each directory showcases a key project, complete with relevant code, methodology, and results.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

- **Product_Success_Prediction_Model/**  
  Developed a machine learning model with Arca Continental to predict the success of new products using engineered DNA features. Compared neural architectures and evaluated using business-aligned KPIs.

- **Intelligent_Shelf_Monitoring/**  
  Hackathon project with FEMSA using YOLOv6 to detect misaligned items on OXXO shelves. Integrated MongoDB data pipelines and prompt-based LLM classification assistance.

- **GovTech_Data_Integration_System/**  
  Developed for the Secretar√≠a de Igualdad e Inclusi√≥n in Nuevo Le√≥n, this system automates data flow using Express.js, Google Sheets API, and Looker Studio dashboards.

- **Hotel_Occupancy_Forecasting_Pipeline/**  
  Built a modular forecasting pipeline (Kedro + MLflow) to predict daily hotel room occupancy. Compared SARIMA, Prophet, GRU, LSTM, and Transformer models. Deployed on Azure with interactive dashboards in Dash.
